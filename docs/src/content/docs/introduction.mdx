**Welcome to pRPC!**

pRPC is an open source [`bling`](https://github.com/tanstack/bling) & [`solid-start`](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start) utility library to make working with `server$` easier. We plan on branching out to support `bling` in the future!

### About

Write simple and interactive SolidStart / Bling code that will run on the server and is easily used on the client - with a fully typesafe API!

### Getting Started

- [React Bling](/react/install)
- [SolidStart](/solid/install)
